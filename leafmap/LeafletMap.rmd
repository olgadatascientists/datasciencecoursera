# R Markdown and Leaflet

## Overview
Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

## Map of Boston

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)

title <- "<b>Boston, May, 28th of 2025</b>"

my_map<- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lat=42.361145, lng=-71.057083, popup="Boston") %>%
  addControl(html=title, position = "topright")
my_map
```
