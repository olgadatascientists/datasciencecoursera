# R Markdown and Leaflet

## Overview
Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly.

## A plot example

```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(plotly)
data <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 2500),
                 c("carat", "price", "clarity", "depth")]
summary(data)

plot_ly(data, x = ~carat, y = ~price, color = ~carat, size = ~carat, text = ~paste("Clarity: ", clarity))  %>%
  layout(title = "Dimond price/carat dependency, May 30th, 2025",
         xaxis = list(title = "Dimonds Carat"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Price"))
```
