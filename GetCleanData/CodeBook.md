## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Analysis

### Description
The project is based on Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### Source Data

### Data Set Information
Please refer the source for original data explanation. 
The current project merges both data sets provided and create a tidy data set according to the requirements:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
